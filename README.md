* Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;
* Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or
* Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.

The game is implemented with standard 1 deck of cards.It has implementation of four standard options for player after receiving two initial cards: __Hit,Double Down , Stand__.The rules for each implementation is described below:

* __Hit__: Draw another card
* __Double Down__: After receiving initial two card, player can draw another card then immediately stand.
* __Stand__:Player takes no more cards and dealer draws cards based on how many times the player drew.

* In the case of a tied score, known as "push" bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21.
